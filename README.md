Hello!
This is a really basic project I made in React to learn React

It's a simple JSON editor, simply add a file and now you can edit all the values, when your done you can download your modified file

to run the project simple clone the repo, run npm i, than npm start

the project should open up and you should have access to the project

Features I might do one day include:
adding new properties, and changing property names

zero promises though, I'm currently moving onto new projects
